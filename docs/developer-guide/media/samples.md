# File Samples

We welcome image and video file samples from our community. You can email them to [samples@photoprism.app](mailto:samples@photoprism.app), either as attachments or with a download link.

Please include the file format and GitHub issue number (if applicable) or other helpful reference (e.g. camera model) in the subject line, and let us know if we have permission to upload your files to [**dl.photoprism.app/samples**](https://dl.photoprism.app/samples/) for future use.
