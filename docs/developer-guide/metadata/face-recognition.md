Since we're already linking against [TensorFlow](../technologies/tensorflow.md) and want to keep the number of dependencies small, we should investigate alternative approaches in addition to the obvious solution to use [dlib](http://dlib.net/) (which is the popular/standard way, see [go-face](https://github.com/Kagami/go-face)). [Pigo](https://github.com/esimov/pigo) is a pure Go implementation for *Face Detection*, but it can not do *Face Recognition*.
