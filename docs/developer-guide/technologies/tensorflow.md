## Using TensorFlow with Go ##

For an introduction please read [Understanding Tensorflow using Go](https://pgaleone.eu/tensorflow/go/2017/05/29/understanding-tensorflow-using-go/).

The TensorFlow API for Go is well suited to loading existing models and executing them within a Go application. It requires the [TensorFlow C library](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/lang_c) to be installed. A full TensorFlow installation is not needed.

It is not possible to statically link against the C library, but the [issue is known](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/15563) and there might be a [fix later this year](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/1920).

## Vision ##

Our long-term goal is to become an open platform for machine learning research based on real-world photo collections.
