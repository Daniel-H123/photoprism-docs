# Running PhotoPrism on openmediavault

!!! tldr ""
    Should you experience problems with the installation, we recommend that you ask the [openmediavault community](https://forum.openmediavault.org/) for advice, as we cannot provide support for third-party software and services.
    Also note that third-party integrations may not provide direct access to config files or the command line, so you might not be able to use all features and config options.

PhotoPrism can be conveniently installed using the openmediavault [plugin](https://www.openmediavault.org/?p=3146).
