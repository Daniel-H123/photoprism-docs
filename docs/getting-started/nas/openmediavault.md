# Running PhotoPrism on openmediavault

!!! danger ""
    Please note that third-party apps may not provide access to the docker-compose.yml file or the command line, and therefore you may not be able to use all of PhotoPrism's features and config options.

!!! tldr ""
    Should you experience problems with the installation, we recommend that you ask the [openmediavault community](https://forum.openmediavault.org/) for advice, as we cannot provide support for third-party software and services.

PhotoPrism can be conveniently installed using the openmediavault [plugin](https://www.openmediavault.org/?p=3146).
