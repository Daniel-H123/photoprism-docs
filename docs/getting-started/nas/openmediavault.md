# Running PhotoPrism on openmediavault

!!! tldr ""
    Should you experience problems with the installation, we recommend that you ask the [openmediavault community](https://forum.openmediavault.org/) for advice, as we cannot provide support for third-party software and services.

PhotoPrism can be conveniently installed using the openmediavault [plugin](https://www.openmediavault.org/?p=3146).
