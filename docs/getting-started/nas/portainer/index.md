# Setup Using Portainer

[Portainer](https://www.portainer.io/) allows you to manage Docker containers through a web interface. On many NAS devices it either comes pre-installed or you can easily install it from the vendor's app store.

### Step 1: Add Stack ###

Navigate to "Stacks", click "Add stack" and [paste the contents of the *stack.yml* file](https://dl.photoprism.app/docker/portainer/stack.yml) into the web editor so that you can change the storage folder locations as needed:

![Screenshot](step-1-add.png){ class="shadow" }

When editing the configuration, please note that related values must start at the same indentation level [in YAML files](../../../developer-guide/technologies/yaml.md) and that tabs are not allowed for indentation. We recommend using 2 spaces.

#### Database ####

Our example includes a pre-configured [MariaDB](https://mariadb.com/) database server. If you remove it 
and provide no other database server credentials, SQLite database files will be created in the 
*storage* folder. Local [SSD storage is best](../../troubleshooting/performance.md#storage) for databases of any kind.

Never [store database files](../../troubleshooting/mariadb.md#corrupted-files) on an unreliable device such as a USB flash drive, SD card, or shared network folder. These may also have [unexpected file size limitations](https://thegeekpage.com/fix-the-file-size-exceeds-the-limit-allowed-and-cannot-be-saved/), which is especially problematic for databases that do not split data into smaller files.

!!! tldr ""
    It is not possible to change the password via `MARIADB_PASSWORD` after the database has been started 
    for the first time. Choosing a secure password is not essential if you don't [expose the database to other apps and hosts](../../troubleshooting/mariadb.md#cannot-connect).
    To enable [automatic schema updates](../../troubleshooting/mariadb.md#auto-upgrade) after upgrading to a new major version, set `MARIADB_AUTO_UPGRADE` to a non-empty value.

#### Volumes ####

Since the app is running inside a container, you have to explicitly [mount the folders](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#volumes) on your device that you want to use.
PhotoPrism won't be able to see folders that have not been mounted. That's an important security feature.

##### /photoprism/originals #####

The *originals* folder contains your original photo and video files:

```yaml
volumes:
  # "/host/folder:/photoprism/folder"  # example
  - "./originals:/photoprism/originals"
```

We recommend that you change `./originals` to the path on your NAS that contains your existing media files. If you keep the default path, it will be located in the internal application folder that Portainer creates automatically.

You can mount [any folder accessible from your NAS](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#short-syntax-3), including [network shares](../../troubleshooting/docker.md#network-storage). Additional directories can also be mounted as subfolders of `/photoprism/originals` (depending on [overlay file system support](../../troubleshooting/docker.md#overlay-volumes)):

```yaml
volumes:
  - "/home/username/Pictures:/photoprism/originals"
  - "/example/friends:/photoprism/originals/friends"
  - "/mnt/photos:/photoprism/originals/media"
```

!!! tldr ""
    If *read-only mode* is enabled, all features that require write permission to the *originals* folder 
    are disabled, e.g. [WebDAV](../../../user-guide/sync/webdav.md), uploading and deleting files. 

##### /photoprism/storage #####

The *storage* folder is used to save SQLite, config, cache, thumbnail and sidecar files:

- a *storage* folder mount (with write access) must always be specified so that you do not lose these files after a restart or upgrade
- never configure the *storage* folder to be inside the *originals* folder unless the name starts with a `.` to indicate that it is hidden
- we recommend placing the *storage* folder on a [local SSD drive](../../troubleshooting/performance.md#storage) for best performance
- mounting [symbolic links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link) or using them inside the *storage* folder is currently not supported

```yaml
volumes:
  - "./storage:/photoprism/storage"
```

!!! tldr ""
    Should you later want to move your instance to another NAS, the easiest and most time-saving way is to copy the entire *storage* folder along with your originals and database.

##### /photoprism/import #####

You can optionally mount an *import* folder from which files can be transferred to the *originals* folder
in a structured way that avoids duplicates:

- [imported files](../../../user-guide/library/import.md) receive a canonical filename and will be organized by year and month
- never configure the *import* folder to be inside the *originals* folder, as this will cause a loop by importing already indexed files

!!! tldr ""
    You can safely skip this. Adding files via [Web Upload](../../../user-guide/library/upload.md)
    and [WebDAV](../../../user-guide/sync/webdav.md) remains possible, unless [read-only mode](../../config-options.md)
    is enabled or the [features have been disabled](../../../user-guide/settings/general.md).

### Step 2: Load Variables ###

[Download the *stack.env* file from our server](https://dl.photoprism.app/docker/portainer/stack.env), click "Load variables from .env file", upload it to Portainer, and then change the values of the [environment variables](../../config-options.md) as needed:

![Screenshot](step-2-config.png){ class="shadow" }

!!! danger ""
    Always change `PHOTOPRISM_ADMIN_PASSWORD` so that the app starts with a **secure initial password**.
    Never use easy-to-guess passwords or default values like `insecure` on publicly accessible servers.
    There is no default in case no password was provided. A minimum length of 8 characters is required.

### Step 3: Deploy Stack ###

When you're done with the configuration, scroll down and click "Deploy the stack" without changing any of the other options:

![Screenshot](step-3-deploy.png){ class="shadow" }

Our [First Steps ðŸ‘£](../../../user-guide/first-steps.md) tutorial will now guide you through the user interface and settings to ensure your library is indexed according to your individual preferences.

!!! tldr ""
    The [config options](../../config-options.md) can be changed at any time by navigating to "Stacks", selecting your existing PhotoPrism stack, clicking "Editor", and then updating the environment variable values to your needs, and then clicking "Update the stack" to apply the changes.

### Troubleshooting ###

If your server runs out of memory, the index is frequently locked, or other system resources are running low:

- [ ] Try [reducing the number of workers](../../config-options.md#index-workers) by setting `PHOTOPRISM_WORKERS` to a reasonably small value, depending on the CPU performance and number of cores
- [ ] Make sure [your server has at least 4 GB of swap space](../../troubleshooting/docker.md#adding-swap) so that indexing doesn't cause restarts when memory usage spikes; RAW image conversion and video transcoding are especially demanding
- [ ] If you are using SQLite, switch to MariaDB, which is [better optimized for high concurrency](../../faq.md#should-i-use-sqlite-mariadb-or-mysql)
- [ ] As a last measure, you can [disable the use of TensorFlow](../../config-options.md#feature-flags) for image classification and facial recognition

Other issues? Our [troubleshooting checklists](../../troubleshooting/index.md) help you quickly diagnose and solve them.

### Command-Line Interface ###

![Screenshot](terminal.png){ class="shadow" }

#### Introduction

`photoprism help` lists all commands and [config options](../../config-options.md) available in the current version:

```bash
docker compose exec photoprism photoprism help
```

Use the `--help` flag to see a detailed command description, for example:

```bash
docker compose exec photoprism photoprism backup --help
```

PhotoPrism's command-line interface is also well suited for job automation using a
[scheduler](https://dl.photoprism.app/docker/scheduler/).

#### Opening a Terminal

To open a terminal session as the current user, you can do the following:

```bash
docker compose exec -u $UID photoprism bash
```

#### Changing the User ID

Specifying a user via `-u $UID` is possible for all commands you run with Docker Compose. In the following examples, it is omitted for brevity.
The currently supported user ID ranges are 0, 33, 50-99, 500-600, and 900-1200. Note that commands will otherwise be executed as *root*.

!!! tip ""
    We also recommend running the PhotoPrism service as a non-root user by setting either the [user service property](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#user) or the `PHOTOPRISM_UID` [environment variable](../../config-options.md#docker-image). Don't forget to update file permissions and/or ownership with the `chown` command when you make changes.
