# Setting Up PhotoPrism on Unraid

!!! tldr ""
    Should you experience problems with the installation, we recommend that you ask the Unraid community for advice, as we cannot provide support for third-party software and services. Also note that third-party integrations may not provide direct access to config files or the command line, so you might not be able to use all features and config options.

!!! attention ""
    Using [SQLite is not recommended](../troubleshooting/sqlite.md) for users who require scalability and high performance. 

We recommend you follow this tutorial [provided by IBRACORP](https://www.youtube.com/c/ibracorp) to install PhotoPrism on [Unraid](https://unraid.net/):
