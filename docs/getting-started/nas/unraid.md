# Setting Up PhotoPrism on Unraid

!!! danger ""
    Please note that third-party apps may not provide access to the docker-compose.yml file or the command line, and therefore you may not be able to use all of PhotoPrism's features and config options.

!!! tldr ""
    Should you experience problems with the installation, we recommend that you ask the Unraid community for advice, as we cannot provide support for third-party software and services.

!!! attention ""
    Note that [SQLite is generally not a good choice](../troubleshooting/sqlite.md) for users who require scalability and high performance. We recommend using MariaDB.

We recommend you follow this tutorial [provided by IBRACORP](https://www.youtube.com/c/ibracorp) to install PhotoPrism on [Unraid](https://unraid.net/):
