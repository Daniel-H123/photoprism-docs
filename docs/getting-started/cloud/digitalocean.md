#### Choose a Plan ####

We recommend hosting PhotoPrism on a server with at least 2 cores and 3 GB of physical memory. Indexing and searching can be slow on smaller Droplets, depending on how many and what types of files you upload.

!!! info ""
    While PhotoPrism has been reported to work on Droplets with less memory, we take no responsibility for instability or performance problems. RAW image conversion and TensorFlow are disabled on Droplets with 1 GB or less memory.

## First Steps
1. Configure [library](../../user-guide/settings/library.md) and [advanced settings](../../user-guide/settings/advanced.md) according to your needs.
2. [Choose](../../user-guide/library/index.md) whether you want to [index your originals](../../user-guide/library/originals.md) so that the existing file and folder names are preserved, or [import them](../../user-guide/library/import.md) so that they are automatically organized by year and month.
3. To add new pictures, you can either copy them to the *import* or *originals* folder [e.g. using WebDAV](../../user-guide/sync/webdav.md), or [upload them with a browser](../../user-guide/library/upload.md), which will import them automatically after upload.
4. Start [indexing](../../user-guide/library/originals.md) or [importing](../../user-guide/library/import.md)
5. Finally, set up [automatic syncing](../../user-guide/sync/mobile-devices.md) from your mobile phone and install the [Progressive Web App (PWA)](../../user-guide/pwa.md) on your desktop, tablet, and phone home screens as needed.
