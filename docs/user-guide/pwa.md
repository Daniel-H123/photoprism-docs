# Mobile App (PWA) #

At the moment, PhotoPrism doesn't have a native mobile app that can be installed through an official app store.
However, our Progressive Web App (PWA) offers an almost native app-like experience. 
You can conveniently install it on the home screen of all major operating systems and mobile devices.

## Install PWA

=== "iOS / Safari"

    1. Open PhotoPrism on your device's browser (on iOS, use Safari)
    2. Click :material-export-variant:
