PhotoPrism® Plus includes advanced multi-user functionality with additional account roles. These roles are intended for applications where multiple users share a single library or, for example, to give family members access to your personal library without granting write permissions or exposing private content.

It is recommended that you set up multiple instances of PhotoPrism® Plus if you have multiple users, such as a family, who want to manage their own files independently and share only selected content. That way you can avoid problems with conflicting library settings, file permissions, and dealing with duplicates.

In a later version of PhotoPrism® Plus, users will be able to share albums and other content in a decentralized way, regardless of where their library is hosted. We are also working on a dedicated web interface for managing multiple libraries and user accounts, which will be made available as a separate tool.

Our ultimate goal is to make personal sharing compatible with other apps like [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.org/) and [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/).
