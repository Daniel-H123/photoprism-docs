# Multiple Libraries

[PhotoPrismÂ® Plus](https://www.photoprism.app/editions#compare) includes advanced multi-user functionality and additional account roles. These roles are intended for situations where you want other users to have access to your library, such as giving family members access to your personal library without granting write permissions or exposing private content.

It is recommended to set up additional instances if you have multiple users in a family, so that everyone can manage their own files independently. This way you can avoid problems with conflicting library settings, file permissions, and dealing with duplicates.

In future versions, users will be able to share albums and other content in a decentralized way, regardless of where their library is hosted. We are also working on a dedicated web interface for managing multiple libraries and user accounts, which will be made available as a separate tool.

Our ultimate goal is to make personal sharing compatible with other apps like [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.org/) and [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/).
