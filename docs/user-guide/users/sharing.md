# Sharing with Guests

To share albums with [guests](roles.md#guest), admins and [users](roles.md#user) can [create share links](../share/index.md), just like when sharing with friends who don't have an account.

When users with limited privileges open a share link while being logged in, they get permanent read-only access to the shared resources until the link is removed or expires.

!!! tldr ""
    In a future release, you will be able to share content with local users directly from the web interface without having to [create links](../share/index.md) first.
