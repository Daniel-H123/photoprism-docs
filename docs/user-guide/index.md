# User Guide #

Step-by-step installation instructions for our self-hosted community edition can be found
in [Getting Started](../getting-started/index.md). All you need is a Web browser and 
[Docker](https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community) to run the server.
It is available for Mac, Linux, and Windows. PhotoPrism also runs on [PikaPods](../getting-started/cloud/pikapods.md), [DigitalOcean](../getting-started/cloud/digitalocean.md),
[Raspberry Pi](../getting-started/raspberry-pi.md), [FreeBSD](../getting-started/freebsd.md), and many
[NAS devices](../getting-started/nas/synology.md).

![Progressive Web App](https://dl.photoprism.app/img/ui/iphone-index-360px.png){ align=right }

Once the [initial setup](../getting-started/index.md) is complete, a [tutorial will guide you](../getting-started/first-steps.md) through the first steps to ensure that your library is indexed according to your individual preferences.
