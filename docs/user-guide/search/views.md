# Search Result Views

PhotoPrism offers you three different views to browse your photos and videos. In addition you can choose between multiple light and dark themes.

=== "Card View"

    The *card view* displays important metadata like title, time and location next to the photos

To switch between views you can either use the filter in the filter bar or the view button (:material-view-column:, :material-view-comfy:, :material-view-list:) in the upper right corner.


Additionally, you can open your photos/videos in *fullscreen mode* and start a slideshow (:material-play:).
