# Browsing and Searching Your Library

PhotoPrism offers many views and search filters so you can explore your photo collection in multiple dimensions instead of just scrolling through it day by day.

This helps you rediscover long-forgotten shots, find specific pictures, or quickly create albums based on search results.

## Views and Filters

Using the main navigation you can visit the different sections of your photo library:

### :material-magnify: Search

Shows all photos and videos that are not in review or archived or private.

!!! hint ""
    In case the review, private or archive functions are turned off - Search displays those photos and videos as well.
