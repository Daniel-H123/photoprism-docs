# Sync Settings

This page describes how PhotoPrism can sync files *from* an external storage system (like ownCloud) via WebDAV.

!!! tldr ""
    Since they are not safe to use without authentication, these settings are not available when running in [public mode](../../getting-started/config-options.md#authentication).

!!! note ""
    PhotoPrism can also serve/share files via WebDAV to be browsed on macOS or Windows.
    See [instructions](/user-guide/sync/webdav/).

## Connect to a WebDAV Server ##

PhotoPrism may connect with WebDAV servers like a second PhotoPrism instance or ownCloud,
so that you can automatically sync your latest pictures.

1. Go to *Settings*
2. Open *Sync tab*
3. Click *Add Server*

    Due to problems with some Nextcloud settings it might be that uploading to Nextcloud results in 0 byte files. You find information on how to solve it [here](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues/443).
