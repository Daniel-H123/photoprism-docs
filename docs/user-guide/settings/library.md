## Index ##

#### :material-chart-timeline-variant: Estimates ####

Estimates the location of pictures taken without GPS information by extrapolating it from the location of other pictures taken on the same day. 

#### :material-eye: Quality Filter ####

Requires a [review of non-photographic and low-quality images](../organize/review.md) before they appear in search results.

#### :material-camera: Convert to JPEG ####

Automatically creates JPEG previews for other file types so they can be displayed in search results and in the full-screen viewer.

!!! attention ""
    *Convert to JPEG* should not be disabled, as this effectively prevents PhotoPrism from indexing file types other than JPEG unless the files have already been converted to JPEG and saved under the same filename prefix.

## Stacks ##

Stacks are groups of files that have the same origin but differ in quality, format, size, or color. Go to *[Photos > Stacks](../organize/stacks.md)* to see all the picture stacks in your library.

PhotoPrism offers three methods for stacking files:

* :material-clock-outline: Place & Time 
* :material-fingerprint: Unique ID
* :material-format-list-numbered-rtl: Sequential Name

!!! attention ""
    If you change the stacking settings, already stacked files will not be unstacked automatically.
