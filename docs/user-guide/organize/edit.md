    Lots of metadata like labels, keywords, title, location, camera details are generated by PhotoPrism 
    itself during indexing. Once you change data manually PhotoPrism always keeps your data even if you index again.
    
!!! tip ""
    Every keyword can be used in PhotoPrisms search to find photos or videos.
    
#### Geolocation Plugin ####

Geolocation Plugin is an [open source extension](https://github.com/andyvalerio/photoprism-geolocation) that makes it easy to change latitude and longitude of a photo by selecting places on a graphical map. It can be [installed through the Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/geolocation-plugin-for-ph/oggmpodnbdcmfiognbkkeffacpeaifch).
