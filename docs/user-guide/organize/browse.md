# Features and Sections #

PhotoPrism offers many views and search filters so that you can browse your pictures in multiple dimensions
instead of only scrolling through them day by day.

This helps you rediscover long-forgotten shots, find specific pictures, or quickly create albums based on filters.

### Views & Filters ###

Using the main navigation you can visit the different sections of your photo library:

#### :material-magnify: Search ####
