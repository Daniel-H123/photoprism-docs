### Development Preview ###

### November 18, 2022 ###
<span class="build">Build 221118-e58fee0fb</span>

This service release includes compatibility fixes for MariaDB 10.10, the [latest translations](https://translate.photoprism.app/projects/photoprism/), a new theme, and updated dependencies. Note that since it is possible that new major versions of MariaDB require changes in PhotoPrism to be compatible, you should check compatibility before upgrading to new MariaDB versions that have been released very recently. We therefore recommend not using the `:latest` tag for the Docker image and to upgrade manually by changing the tag e.g. from `:10.8` to `:10.9` once we had the chance to test the new release:

```yaml
services:
  mariadb:
    image: mariadb:10.9
    ...
```

This service release provides UX improvements for the photo editing dialog and includes the latest [translations contributed by our community](https://translate.photoprism.app/projects/photoprism/).

### November 2, 2022 ###
<span class="build">Build 221102-905925b4d</span>

Due to the many new features, enhancements and bug fixes, this is one of those updates that took longer to release.
Before upgrading, please read the full release notes and note that this release does not yet include support for user roles other than *Admin*, as we need to specify, create and test each new role before we can release it. Once this is done, we will also provide additional user management documentation.

!!! example ""
    We've generated missing translations with the help of DeepL and Google Translate. Native speakers are
    invited to [help us improve those if needed](developer-guide/translations-weblate.md).
    A special thank you to [everyone who contributed](https://docs.photoprism.app/developer-guide/)!

Breaking Changes

- In order to improve security and compatibility, the default Docker image is now based on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish) instead of Debian 12 (Bookworm). The entrypoint script has been updated to [preserve group permissions required for hardware transcoding](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues/2739).
- Session and user management have been re-implemented. **If you are upgrading from a preview build, you will need to run the `photoprism users reset --yes` [command in a terminal](getting-started/docker-compose.md#command-line-interface) after the upgrade to recreate the new database tables so that they are compatible with the stable version. This will not affect your pictures or albums.**
- Upgrading from the last stable version should work without any problems. However, if you have already created additional accounts with the previously offered unofficial multi-user support, you will notice that only the main admin account is migrated automatically. Run `photoprism users legacy` [in a terminal](getting-started/docker-compose.md#command-line-interface) to display the legacy accounts so you can migrate them manually if needed.
- Sharing link visitors can now see the picture locations in the regular album view and optionally on a map after clicking the link. Based on user feedback, we may add settings to hide the locations for enhanced privacy.
- We recommend performing a full rescan after the upgrade to take advantage of new search filters and sort options.
- Indexing is also necessary to find and view HEIC, DNG, and AVIF images that were previously unsupported or had errors. In some cases with incorrectly converted images, it may be necessary to recreate the JPEG sidecar files by running the `photoprism convert -f` command [in a terminal](getting-started/docker-compose.md#command-line-interface) before starting the rescan. To regenerate your thumbnails, run `photoprism thumbs -f`.

### December 15, 2021 ###
<span class="build">Build 211215-93b26f19</span>

PhotoPrism is not directly affected by the [Apache Log4j](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2021/12/log4j-zero-day-log4shell-arrives-just-in-time-to-ruin-your-weekend) vulnerability.
Logs may still contain messages that can cause harm if consumed by an unpatched Java application.
As a precaution, this release includes additional [rules and filters to validate user input](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues/1814).

- Sharing: [Fixed album link redirect on shared domains](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues/1617)
- Import: [More helpful warning when another import is already running](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues/1810)

### December 10, 2021 ###
<span class="build">Build 211210-2cb90e7e</span>

Starting with this release, the [regular multi-arch Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/photoprism/photoprism/tags?name=latest) is 64-bit only. 
A 32-bit version of our stable release for [older devices](getting-started/raspberry-pi.md#older-armv7-based-devices) 
is offered separately. This frees up development and infrastructure resources with minimal impact.

- Security: [Upgraded Go to v1.17.5, which includes HTTP/2 and networking fixes](https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/hcmEScgc00k)
- People: [Concurrent updates are no longer possible to prevent inconsistencies](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/commit/1b583e071e80b68352b1b366d60e010d8f8f9535)

### December 3, 2021 ###
<span class="build">Build 211203-fdb6b5e1</span>

Since the [funding goal](https://link.photoprism.app/sponsor) required to make all features and maps generally
available has not been reached, *early-access features* have been renamed to *sponsor features* in this update.
Offline and high-resolution street maps remain free for everyone, while hybrid, topographic, and outdoor maps are 
now a sponsor feature. We believe this is fair. A big thank you to all our [sponsors](https://link.photoprism.app/sponsors)
and [contributors](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/graphs/contributors/)!

- CLI: [Improved parameter](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues/1778) and [command descriptions](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues/1735)

### November 28, 2021 ###
<span class="build">Build 211128-7e8974fd</span>

Official support for MySQL 8 is discontinued with this update as Oracle seems to have stopped shipping [new features and enhancements](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues/1764).
As a result, the testing effort required before each release is no longer feasible. We recommend [upgrading](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/#version-upgrade)
to [MariaDB 10.6](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/function-differences-between-mariadb-106-and-mysql-80/) or later.
PostgreSQL support is [planned for 2022](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues/47) without a specific release date yet.

- CLI: [`photoprism migrations run --failed` will re-run previously failed migrations](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/commit/7e8974fd20fcbf3ec403541125599deaeb1ee353)

### November 27, 2021 ###
<span class="build">Build 211127-86c43159</span>

When possible, location estimates now include a latitude and longitude. Photos load faster when you open 
them in *Places*, and the viewer sorts them by distance. Time zone handling has been completely reworked, 
in particular for UTC. The Docker base image has been upgraded to Ubuntu 21.10, which ships with 
Darktable 3.6 among other updated dependencies.

### Getting Updates ###

Even when you use an image with the `:latest` tag, Docker does not automatically download new images for you. To update, you can either [manually pull the most recent image](getting-started/updates.md) and restart, or set up a service like [Watchtower](getting-started/updates.md#watchtower) to get automatic updates.
